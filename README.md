A build system for multiple architectures and operating systems. Project files 
define Makefiles to be written that can be copied to a remote system or be 
completely built on a remote system.

## Status
yabs can currently self host. Major things that are left to implement are:

- [ ] Remote jobs (ssh and or git)
- [ ] Better language detection (& add more languages)
- [ ] Better distribution tarballs
- [ ] Pre/Post scripting
- [x] Direct building (omitting Make)

Yabs currently only works well with C and C++ and only with certain file 
extensions

## Building

You may use the `Makefile` provided, a qmake profile is available if you wish to 
 compile with clang:
```
qmake "CONFIG+=clang"
```

## Using
```bash
~/Project $ cat hello-yabs.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello yabs!\n");
	return 0;
}
~/Project $ yabs -n
New build file written as: Project.ybf
```
**Edit the build file to reflect the language used**
```bash
---
lang: c
...
```
**Build it**
```bash
~/Project $ yabs -b Project.ybf
g++ -c -I/usr/include -I/usr/local/include -o hello-yabs.o hello-yabs.c
g++ -o Project hello-yabs.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib
~/Project $ ./Project
Hello yabs!

```
