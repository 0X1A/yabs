# yabs
Yet another build system. A C and C++ build system, with projects described
using TOML.

## Building
To build `yabs` you will need `rustc` and `cargo`. Simply run `cargo build
--release`, this will build a binary called `yabs` in `target/release`.

## Using
Usage of yabs is currently not recommended as the user interface is not quite
completed. Though to get a general idea of a schema for a project see
`yabs.toml`, and `yabs --help` for options and arguments.
